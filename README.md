# Coworking Project

Our first project in common at the Wild Code School. 
We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a showcase website for our fictional client. 

After a meticulous modeling on Figma and a #UX/UI reflection for the design, we worked as a team to offer a "one page" and responsive site, with a "mobile first" approach.

We worked in team with Git and GitHub.
